        <h2>1. Standard Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise mentioned for a specific trek or package, the following standard cancellation rules apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>15 days or more before the start date:</strong>
            Full refund of the amount paid, after deduction of any non-refundable transaction or processing charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>7 to 14 days before the start date:</strong>
            50% refund of the total trip cost. The remaining amount may be adjusted towards a future trek in some cases,
            subject to availability and management approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Less than 7 days before the start date:</strong>
            No refund. However, we will do our best to help you with rescheduling options where possible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. No-Show or Early Departure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No refund will be provided for participants who do not show up on the reporting date.</li>
          <li>
            If you decide to leave the trek or tour after it has started (due to personal reasons, health, or any other cause),
            no refund will be applicable for the unused portion of the trip.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Trip Cancellation or Changes by Global Events Travels</h2>
        <p>
          In rare cases, we may have to cancel or modify a trek or tour due to reasons beyond our control, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extreme or unsafe weather conditions</li>
          <li>Natural disasters or landslides</li>
          <li>Political unrest, local restrictions, or government orders</li>
          <li>Insufficient group size or operational challenges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In such situations, we will offer one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full or partial refund, depending on expenses already incurred, <em>or</em></li>
          <li>
            Transfer of your booking amount to an alternative date or another trek/package of similar value,
            as mutually agreed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Rescheduling Requests</h2>
        <p>
          If you wish to reschedule your trek dates instead of cancelling, we will try our best to accommodate
          your request based on availability:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rescheduling 15+ days before the start date is usually allowed with minimal or no additional charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rescheduling within 7–14 days may involve adjustment fees or partial forfeiture, depending on logistics already arranged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rescheduling within 7 days of the start date is generally not possible, but you can contact our team
            to see if any exceptions can be made.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Refund Process &amp; Timelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method wherever possible.</li>
          <li>Refund processing may take between 7–14 working days, depending on the payment gateway or bank.</li>
          <li>
            Any transaction, convenience, or gateway fees charged by banks or payment processors are generally non-refundable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Partial Payments &amp; Advance</h2>
        <p>
          If you have paid only an advance amount at the time of booking, refunds will be calculated on the
          total trek cost and not just the advance. In some cases, the advance may be fully or partially non-refundable
          if we have already incurred logistics or booking costs.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Health, Fitness &amp; Medical Issues</h2>
        <p>
          If you are unable to continue or start the trek due to health or fitness issues, the standard
          cancellation policy will still apply. We strongly recommend obtaining travel insurance that covers
          medical emergencies, evacuation, and trip cancellation.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Contact for Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>

        <p class="text-xs text-neutral-500 mt-8">
          This policy is a general guideline. Specific treks, expeditions, or promotional offers may have
          special cancellation rules, which will be informed at the time of booking and will take precedence
          over the above terms.
